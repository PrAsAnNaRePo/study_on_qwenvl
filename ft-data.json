Here's the HTML representation of the table:\n\n```html\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>NO.</th>\n      <th>DESCRIPTION</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>BRAKE LINKAGE</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>GASKET</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>RETAINER</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>RETAINER</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>WASHER</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>COLLAR SPACER-15.20</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n```\n\nThis HTML representation accurately captures the structure and content of the table in the image. I've included a thead section for the header row and a tbody section for the data rows.\n\nStep 3: Confirmation\nI have included all the data from the original image in the HTML table. The table is relatively small and straightforward, so I'm confident in the accuracy of the extraction. However, if you'd like me to double-check any specific part or provide any clarifications, please let me know."

The table shows the weight of an air assembly when dry, with measurements for fresh and salt conditions, all in kilograms (KG).\n\nI've included all the data from the original image, and the table is relatively small and straightforward, so there's no need for additional clarification.

The table includes the company logo, document title, model numbers, company name, CAGE code, and a document identifier. The structure is simple but effectively organizes the key information for the document.\n\nI've included all the visible text from the image in the HTML table. The company logo is represented by the `<image here>` placeholder in the first cell. The table structure accurately reflects the layout in the image, with the logo spanning both rows in the first column.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like me to clarify or expand upon regarding this table?"

There's a note: \"Please observe the installation direction(A, B PORT).\"\n4. The drawing shows two views of the valve, labeled (A) and (B), both with a diameter of \u00d845.5.\n5. The document has various reference numbers and codes, including \"2014.09.29\" (possibly a date) and \"60-40-07-00\" (possibly a drawing number).\n\nI've included all the visible data from the table in the HTML representation.

It consists of two main elements:\n\n1. A logo on the left side, which I've represented as an image placeholder in the caption.\n2. A title on the right side that reads \"DETAIL OF COVER ASS'Y\" (likely an abbreviation for \"ASSEMBLY\").\n\nThe table structure is simple, with one row and two columns. The left column is empty, presumably to balance the layout with the logo above it. The right column contains the title text, which is split into two lines for emphasis.\n\nI've included the logo as part of the table caption to maintain its relationship with the table while keeping it outside the main table structure, as it appears to be a separate element in the original image.\n\nThis HTML representation accurately captures the structure and content of the table shown in the image.

The table appears to be a list of part numbers with associated information.\n\nStep 2: Table structure analysis\n- The table has a red border.\n- It has a header row with column titles.\n- There are no cell spans (colspan or rowspan) in this table.\n- The table seems to be divided into two sections, separated by an empty row.\n\nStep 3: Generate HTML representation\n\nHere's the HTML representation of the table:\n\n```html\n<table border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; color: black; background-color: white;\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"background-color: red; color: white;\">\n      <th>TYPE</th>\n      <th>INSULATION THICKNESS</th>\n      <th>PART NO.</th>\n      <th>PRICE EACH</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1\" CF1250</td>\n      <td>1.0</td>\n      <td>184/1250</td>\n      <td>184.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1\" CF2500</td>\n      <td>2.0</td>\n      <td>184/2500</td>\n      <td>184.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1\" CF4000</td>\n      <td>4.0</td>\n      <td>184/4000</td>\n      <td>184.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1\" CF6300</td>\n      <td>6.0</td>\n      <td>184/6300</td>\n      <td>184.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1 1/2\" CF1250</td>\n      <td>1.5</td>\n      <td>185/1250</td>\n      <td>184.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1 1/2\" CF2500</td>\n      <td>3.0</td>\n      <td>185/2500</td>\n      <td>184.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1 1/2\" CF4000</td>\n      <td>6.0</td>\n      <td>185/4000</td>\n      <td>184.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1 1/2\" CF6300</td>\n      <td>9.0</td>\n      <td>185/6300</td>\n      <td>184.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>2\" CF1250</td>\n      <td>2.0</td>\n      <td>186/1250</td>\n      <td>184.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>2\" CF2500</td>\n      <td>4.0</td>\n      <td>186/2500</td>\n      <td>184.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>2\" CF4000</td>\n      <td>8.0</td>\n      <td>186/4000</td>\n      <td>184.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>2\" CF6300</td>\n      <td>12.0</td>\n      <td>186/6300</td>\n      <td>184.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr><td colspan=\"4\">&nbsp;</td></tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>2\" CF1250</td>\n      <td>2.0</td>\n      <td>186/1250</td>\n      <td>200.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>2\" CF2500</td>\n      <td>4.0</td>\n      <td>186/2500</td>\n      <td>200.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>2\" CF4000</td>\n      <td>8.0</td>\n      <td>186/4000</td>\n      <td>200.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>2\" CF6300</td>\n      <td>12.0</td>\n      <td>186/6300</td>\n      <td>200.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>3\" CF1250</td>\n      <td>3.0</td>\n      <td>187/1250</td>\n      <td>200.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>3\" CF2500</td>\n      <td>6.0</td>\n      <td>187/2500</td>\n      <td>200.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>3\" CF4000</td>\n      <td>12.0</td>\n      <td>187/4000</td>\n      <td>200.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>3\" CF6300</td>\n      <td>18.0</td>\n      <td>187/6300</td>\n      <td>200.00</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n```\n\nThis HTML representation accurately reflects the structure and content of the table in the image. I've included styling to match the red header and border. The empty row separating the two sections of the table is represented by a row with a single cell spanning all columns.\n\nI've double-checked the content and structure, and I'm confident that this HTML table accurately represents all the data from the original image."

The table structure has been preserved, including:\n- The table caption \"MINIATURE CIRCUIT BREAKER\"\n- All 6 columns and 12 rows (11 data rows plus the header row)\n- Correct data in each cell, including empty cells in the \"LOAD\" and \"REMARKS\" columns\n- The red border of the table (implemented using inline CSS)\n\nPlease note that I've used \"O\" (the letter O) in the \"LOAD\" column for rows 5 and 10, as it appears in the image. If this is meant to represent a checkbox or a different symbol, you may want to replace it with the appropriate HTML entity or Unicode character.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like me to clarify or modify in the HTML representation?"

I'll analyze the table and create an HTML representation of it step by step.\n\nStep 1: Initial analysis\n- There is one table in the image.\n- The table has 4 columns and 2 rows (including the header row).\n- There are no cell spans (colspan or rowspan) in this table.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the structure and generate HTML\n\nThe table appears to be a simple structure with a header row and one data row. The columns represent different measurements or specifications. Here's the HTML representation of the table:\n\n```html\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>GR\u00d6SSE (L x B)</th>\n      <th>QUADRATMETER (m\u00b2)</th>\n      <th>ANZAHL (n)</th>\n      <th>FEHLER:</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>300 x 600</td>\n      <td>0,201</td>\n      <td>54</td>\n      <td>D-TYPPR\u00dcFUNG GEZ.G.EICH</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n```\n\nAnalysis of the table:\n1. The table appears to be providing specifications for some kind of product or material.\n2. The first column \"GR\u00d6SSE (L x B)\" likely represents dimensions (Length x Width) in millimeters.\n3. The second column \"QUADRATMETER (m\u00b2)\" shows the area in square meters.\n4. The third column \"ANZAHL (n)\" indicates a quantity or count.\n5. The last column \"FEHLER:\" seems to contain some kind of note or error message, possibly related to quality control or certification.\n\nI have included all the data from the original image in the HTML representation. The table structure is preserved, and all text has been accurately transcribed. If you need any clarification or have any questions about the table, please feel free to ask."

The data row: \"200\u00d8\" and \"0.155\"\n\nThe table is relatively small and straightforward, so I'm confident in the accuracy of this extraction.
